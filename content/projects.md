## STEP (System for TEaching Programming)

_Sprint 2020_

Bachelor Thesis

The system enabled teachers to easily enable
students to use tools they had developed over the
browser instead of having to setup their
environment and install them themselves. The
system consisted of:

- A in-browser react compiler for generating react
  websites.
- A backend for running each of the tools in their
  needed docker environments

To demonstrate the system I implemented a tool
using the system. The tool was a compiler of the
language _Secure Guarded Commands_ developed by
Proffessor Flemming Nielson. The language had the
properties that it enabled compile time checks of
security aspects related to information flow, such
that e.g. private information cannot flow into
publicly available variables. This compiler was
developed in the functional programming language
F#.

### Tech Stack

Typescript, React.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Node.js,
Google Analytics, F#,

## E-tendance

## Tech Stack

## Chineese Checkers AI

Implemented in Java interfaced to via terminal.
Uses Alpha-beta pruned Mini-max algorithm
optimised via heuristics function based on
distance to the center line. The AI was able to
reach a super human level, where it would win in
100/100 games.

### Tech stack

Java, System I/O (In other words `terminal`).
Focus was on the model.

## Chatbot project

_June 2019_

Developed a NLP-chatbot for use in financial
company. The Chatbot is interactive in the sense
that it can directely manipulate the website based
on what actions you ask it to execute. Also it can
answer questions by searching through a database
of information and extract the text that most
likely is the answer to the question via machine
learning.

### Tech stack:

Dialogflow, Node.js, Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML, CSS,
mySQL, REST API.

## Multiplayer Online Snake

_January 2019_

### Abstract

> This report details the implementation of a
> distributed application in the form of a
> multiplayer game. We have designed the game to
> be a real-time multiplayer combination of TRON,
> Achtung Die Kurve and Superhex, three
> ‘Snake’-like games. The multiplayer aspect was
> implemented using the pSpace-library (jSpace). A
> big emphasis of the architecture was to secure
> against malicious activities. In order to ensure
> a responsive feel for the players and no
> advantage for any given player, a separate
> server-client relationship was implemented, and
> all the game logic was implemented server side.
> This also makes it difficult for players to
> cheat, since the only communication from the
> client to server is movement commands. The game
> also includes a chat system for the different
> users to communicate with each other during a
> game.

### Tech stack:

Java, jSpace (Distributed Algorithm), JavaFx (UI).

## Apple ARKit Special Course

_June 2018_

Created a special course and gathered a team. We
implemented an Augmented Reality iOS app for use
in SMEs. It made it possible to localise an
visualise IOT-sensors inside buildings. This would
make maintenance of IOT-sensors more convenient
and user friendly.

### Tech stack:

Swift, UIKit, ARKit, XCode.

## Microsoft Hackathon Skyscanner app

_April 2018_

Together with my team we developed a AR app for
[Skyscanner](http://skyscanner.com), that was able
to localise near countries and create an overview
of the travel destination.

### Tech stack:

Swift, ARKit, XCode, Skyscanner API.
